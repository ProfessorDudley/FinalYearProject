	<h3>Munchkin is a roguelike game with run progression and turn based combat.</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		Drop into a unique dungeon each time you play. Explore the dungeon on an isometric grid. Collect loot cards and level up your characters. Fight monsters with an intuitive, card-based, turn by turn combat system.

		From the outset of this project I wanted to challenge myself to build something ridiculously technical. I also have previously enjoyed playing Steve Jackson’s Munchkin with my friends, but have always found the game confusing to play if you hadn’t played in a while.
I wanted to find a way to make Munchkin more accessible to play, without needing to reach for the instructions every time my friends and I wanted to play. This resulted in Munchkin - The Randomly Generated, Turn by Turn, Roguelike Game.
