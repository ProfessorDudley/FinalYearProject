excerpt: "If you could expect anyone to make a mountain out of a molehill, it is me. Rather than writing the project proposal, or
doing background research, I find myself trying to shoehorn in a blog into GitHub. It's not actually hard - just time
consuming. But after a few long nights, I have actually created my own blog for writing these posts throughout development."

  If you could expect anyone to make a mountain out of a molehill, it is me. Rather than writing the project proposal, or

  consuming. But after a few long nights, I have actually created my own blog for writing these posts throughout development.

<p>
  I thought it would be a good idea to keep all my information in one place. So I made sure everything was stoed in GitHub.
  The Project, the Blogs, the schedule and bug lists, etc. GitHub also has an issue tracker to help with bug and feature tracking.
