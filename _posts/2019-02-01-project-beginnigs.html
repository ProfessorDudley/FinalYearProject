<h3> Well this has been an intresting way to start development of a game.</h3>

<p>If you could expect anyone to make a mountain out of a molehill, it is me. Rather than writing the project proposal, or 
  doing background research, I find myself trying to shoehorn in a blog into GitHub. It's not actually hard - just time 
  consuming. But after a few long nights, I have actually created my own blog for writing these posts throughout development.
  </p>

<p> I thought it would be a good idea to keep all my information in one place. So I made sure everything was stoed in GitHub. 
  The Project, the Blogs, the schedule and bug lists, etc. GitHub also has an issue tracker to help with bug and feature tracking.
